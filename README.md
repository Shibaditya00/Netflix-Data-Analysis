## 📽️ About Netflix

Netflix, founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California, by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph, began as a DVD-by-mail service. Hastings, a Computer Scientist and Mathematician, co-founded the company after being inspired by a hefty late fee from a traditional video rental store. Randolf, a Marketing Executive played a pivotal role in Netflix's early user interface and branding.
In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming services, allowing subscribers watch movies and TV shows instantly online. This strategic shift capitalized on the growing internet bandwidth and changing consumer preferences, propelling Netflix into a leading global streaming platform. By 2010, the company began its international expansion, started with Canada, and by 2016, it was available in over 190 countries.
As of 2024, Netflix reported a revenue of nearly $10 billion in the third quarter, with profits reaching $2.4 billion. 
The platform boasts over 283 million paid memberships across more than 190 countries, offering a vast library of TV series, films and games in various genres and languages.
Overall, Netflix's evolution from a DVD rental service to a global streaming giant underscores its adaptability and innovative approach in the entertainment industry.
